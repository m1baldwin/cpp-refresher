# CPP refresher 
Guided practice of basic cpp concepts to refresh on the language.    
  
1. Variables and Input/Output  
- Write a program that asks the user for their name and age, then prints a greeting.  
2. Control Flow  
- Write a program that takes an integer and prints whether it is even or odd.  
- Write a program that prints all numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3 print "Fizz", for multiples of 5 print "Buzz", and for multiples of both print "FizzBuzz".  
3. Functions  
- Write a function that takes two integers and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD).  
- Write a function to check if a number is prime.   
4. Arrays and Loops  
- Write a program that finds the largest element in an array.  
- Write a program that reverses an array in place.  
5. Pointers and References  
- Write a function that swaps two integers using pointers.  
- Write a function that returns the sum of elements in an array using pointers.  
6. Classes and Objects  
- Define a class for a simple BankAccount with deposit, withdraw, and display methods.  
- Implement a class for a 2D point with methods for distance calculation.  
7. File I/O  
- Write a program that reads numbers from a file and calculates their sum.  
- Write a program that writes user input to a file.  
8. Advanced Topics  
- Implement a simple linked list with insert and delete operations.
- Write a program that uses STL vectors and maps to count word frequencies in a text

## Deep Dive 

**1. Variables and Input/Output**  
A program prompts the user for their name and age using `std::cin`, then prints a personalized greeting with `std::cout`.

**2. Control Flow**  
A program reads an integer from the user and uses an `if` statement to print whether it is even or odd.

**3. Functions**  
A function is implemented to take two integers and return their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm.

**4. Arrays and Loops**  
A function iterates through an integer array using a pointer and sums all elements, demonstrating pointer arithmetic and loop constructs.

**5. Pointers and References**  
A function is written that takes two integer pointers and swaps their values using a temporary variable.

**6. Classes and Objects**  
A `BankAccount` class is defined with private member variables and public methods for depositing, withdrawing, and displaying account information, with implementation split between header and source files.
